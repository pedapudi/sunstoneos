# Select checks by changed behavior

Before a test batch, state the changed behavior, credible failure risk, and
smallest check that resolves that risk. Run focused checks during iteration.
Broaden testing when a shared dependency changes, a failure reveals wider impact,
or a milestone lacks integration evidence.

| Change | Initial verification | Broaden when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documentation | Review changed statements and links | Commands or build instructions changed |
| Build or packaging | Build the affected target and inspect the artifact | Toolchain, boot layout, or shared configuration changed |
| Local driver behavior | Affected transfer, error, or recovery case | Shared clocks, DMA, interrupts, or power behavior changed |
| Scheduler, memory, DMA | Relevant concurrency and ownership checks | Integration exposes shared-resource effects |
| mimus platform adapter | Affected fixture and host parity | Model loading, scheduling, or arithmetic changed |
| mimus arithmetic | Kernel fixtures and deterministic reference comparison | Arithmetic intentionally changes, requiring accuracy evaluation |
| Hardware repeatability | Predeclared repeated trial | Failure or variance changes the hypothesis |

Do not add tests that merely repeat implementation details. Do not run accuracy
studies for non-numerical changes. Preserve mimus restrictions on held-out data
and training. Its substantive parity and concurrency requirements remain valid.

## Reuse valid evidence

A successful result remains valid when its relevant inputs are unchanged:

- Source and dependency contents used by the test.
- Toolchain, build configuration, and generated image.
- Test implementation, fixtures, and model contents.
- Hardware identity, peripheral configuration, and relevant device state.

A commit, conflict-free rebase, handoff, or final response is not an input change.
Use existing build dependencies and a small evidence record before introducing
new caching infrastructure. Missing dependency information prevents reuse only
for checks affected by that uncertainty.

Build once per changed target. Flash only when the required running image differs.
Run hardware cases in one controlled session when practical. Do not rebuild or
reflash between cases that use the same artifact.

## Integration and repeatability

At a milestone, run acceptance cases that lack valid evidence on the final
candidate. Preserve earlier evidence that still applies. Lower-level checks do
not substitute for an integration case that has never run.

Repeated trials need a purpose and a sample count or stopping rule. Examples
include boot reliability, timing variance, race reproduction, and reconnect
behavior. A failed attempt is not permission to retry indefinitely.

For each batch, record the purpose, command or procedure, artifact identity,
hardware state, result, and raw-evidence location. Keep raw logs outside Git.
Record an untested requirement as untested, even when a related check passes.
