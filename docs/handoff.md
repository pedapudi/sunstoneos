# Current work

Continue in `/home/sunil/git/sunstoneos-worktrees/bringup` toward the
[accepted goal](goal.md). Read `AGENTS.md` and the relevant device skill before
new work. The [hardware matrix](hardware.md) remains the complete support
inventory; component documents hold APIs, source provenance and detailed evidence.

The user cannot reconnect either board until further notice. No board access or
new hardware launch is authorized while physical recovery is unavailable. Do not
request another reconnect. Both queues were idle at the last observation; no live
query has been made since the announced second-board disconnection. Continue
offline implementation and integration. Earlier identities and admission records
supply no current authority.

Neither board has populated eMMC or UFS. Do not probe or require qualification of
these absent devices. Preserve both microSD cards and their native support.
No MIPI camera, display or microphone is attached. OV5640 is the first sensor
target; the DSI panel is undecided. Use recorded audio for mimus meanwhile.

## Board state and recovery

| Board | Power and access facts | Continuation requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Original, host port `3-1` | Separate 5 V/3 A supply; removing the USB data cable may leave power applied. Accepted eight-core first-task result is below. | Refresh identity, recovery and admission before any eventual bounded test. Full workload execution is deferred. |
| Second, host port `3-3` | USB was its only power source. Last confirmed removal recovered `003:073`, identity `[7,3858,1097032,0,0]`; ROM/access passed, retained processes stopped and the failed claim closed. | That recovery predates the planned disconnection. Require fresh cold DDR and platform admission when available. Evidence: `usb-first-fault-20261018/root-physical-064/recovery-073.json`. |

Per-port permissions, locks, queues and failure records remain independent.
Reconnect rules last covered `3-1` and `3-3` until host reboot; future access must
verify permissions and explicitly select the port. The separate ESP32 mimus
keyboard is unrelated: do not use it as the Orange Pi console or send desktop
keyboard events.

The preceding second-board USB takeover returned to ROM with native status 1
before controller writes. Its guard rejected the inherited device-session bit at
`0x04100040`. The integrated correction permits that bit while requiring device
role, excluding host request/mode and retaining DMA checks. Software checks and
review pass under `usb-rom-session-20261018/`; physical takeover is unqualified.
Failure evidence: `usb-first-fault-20261018/physical-064/runtime/`.

## CPU evidence and next physical decision

The primary agent owns all multicore implementation, review and board testing.
[Arm/Linux source audit](a733-multicore-reference-audit.md) and
[startup records](a733-smp-supervised.md) preserve the architectural decisions.

All eight CPUs physically reach their initial FreeRTOS task context and return
safely. Actual construction and restoration record each core's idle-task pointer,
stack, argument and exception state. The production barrier and 256 atomic
increments also pass. All writers finish before cleaning the 145-page writable
interval, or 9,280 cache lines per CPU. CPU0 restores controls; all seven
secondaries acknowledge shutdown and reach independently observed OFF. Saved
DRAM restoration and responsive ROM return pass. Reuse
`all-core-first-task-20261018/physical-010/runtime/session.json`.
This physical diagnostic excludes task bodies, timer interrupts and application
SGIs; it does not qualify sustained multicore scheduling.

The following extensions pass software checks only:

| CPU workload | Accepted scope and required preservation | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context switching | Actual idle yield, context save/selection/restoration and pinned-worker entry on all eight cores; wrong arguments retain cores. USB observer is suppressed. Worker bodies and timer/SGI work remain excluded. | `all-core-task-switch-20261018/build-no-observer/`, `host/software.json`, `host-root-review.json` in that evidence directory |
| Full returning workload | Each core completes 32 floating-point rounds, background work and SGIs; CPU0 services the production timer. Final-writer stop, interrupt cleanup, Nonsecure memory publication and matched shutdown are reviewed. Timing/coherence remain modeled. | `all-core-task-workload-20261019/frozen/`, `host-frozen/`, `host-root-review.json` |

The full-workload damaged-round-count refusal reuses its saved completed
checkpoint. Host checks validate workload results, epochs, task contexts,
timer-priority restoration, saved RAM and retained transport failure. Do not
repeat the earlier unobserved full launch unchanged. When recovery becomes
available, refresh board admission and select one bounded test for a concrete
remaining question; no CPU test is currently queued.

Preserve the accepted returning CPU diagnostic ELF
`762237cd0f023a2c6895167b347352bb383e1012b5c39d1f8f0139278a68dba3`.
Rebuilding requires new symbol and patch bindings; documentation changes do not
justify replacing the frozen artifact.

## Integrated component status

All rows below describe implemented, software-checked paths. They do not grant
physical admission. Modeled hardware, scheduler, cache, transport and numerical
boundaries remain those of each referenced record. Evidence paths are relative
to `~/.cache/sunstoneos/evidence/`. The hardware matrix covers remaining onboard
functions and modes beyond these bounded applications.

| Component and canonical specification | Current scope and remaining limit | Accepted evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PCIe endpoint COPY](pcie-test-application.md) | One trusted direct `pci-epf-test` endpoint: selected BAR/iATU, 4,096-byte DMA COPY, one-shot MSI and immutable copied USB output. Hardware/scheduling are modeled. Requires endpoint-specific DMA-before-unmap and data-before-status/MSI authority; none exists yet. All resources remain retained; physical DMA/MSI, all-core startup and recovery remain unqualified. | `pcie-endpoint-20261019/root-integration.json`; `root/review.json` in that directory |
| [DSI immutable-frame replay](display-scanout.md#caller-uploaded-immutable-frame-replay) | Two authenticated XRGB8888 uploads selected 0→1→0 through the register command queue (RCQ) at modeled 720p/1080p. Fresh RCQ completion plus later DE frame-end bind copied results; full USB delivery precedes next request. Frames/command pages stay immutable: no retirement, recycling or arbitrary new-frame streaming. No attached panel, physical pixels, electrical qualification or shared startup execution. | `display-frame-present-20261019/root-integration.json`; `root/layout-review.json` in that directory |
| [UART2](uart-application.md) | Finite FIFO exchange plus owner-task IRQ service and completed drain. Physical loopback, electrical admission, interrupts and inherited startup remain unqualified; DMA/wider modes remain required. | `uart-native-20261018/integration.json`; `uart-irq-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [I2S duplex/repeated service](i2s-application.md), [cyclic DMA](i2s-stream.md) | Separate TX/RX channels; copied slots survive cancellation until delivery/ACK. Fixed cyclic TX and checked-copy RX/duplex are integrated. Continuity, cache visibility and wire drain remain unqualified; RX ordering blocker is below. | `i2s-duplex-20261018/integration.json`; `i2s-repeated-20261018/root-integration.json`; `i2s-hardware-cyclic-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [Runtime I2S PCM/file input](i2s-application.md#complete-file-input-retains-unknown-serial-completion) | Finite TX leases accept BEGIN_FILE/END_INPUT with a short final period. Normal EOF requires exact DMA consumption and FIFO empty; wire completion is unknown. TX/GEN, clocks, pins, catalogue and buffers remain retained; REAP/CLOSE refuse. Explicit CANCEL may truncate; prefix-plus-guards mode remains separate. Native/provider and client/host checks model hardware; physical playback/drain remain unqualified. | `i2s-file-playback-20261019/root-integration.json`; earlier refills: `i2s-runtime-pcm-20261019/` |
| [Combined mimus/storage](../apps/mimus-board/README.md) | Unchanged EL0 recognizer plus read-only USB sector service in one supervised image. Success requires storage copy during recognition and fresh liveness. Native fixture injects recognition-active/transcript and models hardware/scheduling; separate host recognition matches the historical recording. No physical concurrency/timing claim. | `mimus-board-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [Repeated Bluetooth recognition](bluetooth-native.md#repeated-headset-capture-and-recognition) | CVSD copied input and delivery-owned transcripts; unchanged recognizer remains EL0. Optional mSBC decodes 16 kHz speech through the same path. Transparent eSCO, receive bounds, acoustic quality and session timing remain physically unqualified. | `bluetooth-repeated-recognition-20261019/root-integration.json`; `bluetooth-msbc-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [Bluetooth caller PCM](bluetooth-native.md#caller-pcm-playback-and-duplex) | mSBC playback-only and recognition duplex; two immutable 2,400-byte periods, full USB delivery and ticket ACK before reuse. END seals admission; CANCEL can truncate audio. Credits/disconnect account for buffers, not rendering or wire drain. Image-specific case boundary is below. | `bluetooth-pcm-duplex-20261019/root-integration.json`, `profile-gate-delta.json` |
| [Read-only SD](storage-read-application.md) | Legacy one-bit 400 kHz, four-bit default up to CSD/25 MHz, or required high speed at 50 MHz. USB-layout reconciliation was accepted at `894051d`; later headers do not invalidate that frozen image. No writes or physical mode qualification. | `sd-bus-modes-20261019/`; `sd-shared-usb-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [Optional eMMC reads](emmc-read-application.md) | SDC2/SDC3 identification, EXT_CSD and copied reads pass instruction/host checks. Neither current board has a qualification target. The single-core image retains resources and has no qualified ROM return. | `emmc-native-20261018/` |
| [Full-HD H.264](h264-native.md#full-hd-streaming-and-extended-memory) | Baseline IDR/P, one reference/POC2; coded 1920×1088 retains references, copied 1920×1080 removes eight bottom rows. At most 256 AUs, 4 MiB each. Six-picture allocator/table/controller/crop/copy composition is modeled; normal mode checks one picture. Private entry checks exclude shared startup. | `h264-fullhd-20261019/root-integration.json`, `root-startup-layout-review.json` |
| [VGA/legacy H.264](h264-native.md) | VGA admits 256 prepared 640×480 pictures, 512 KiB/AU; legacy 48×32 IDR/P remains separate. Input refill, reference retirement and copied-output ACK are distinct. Corrected launcher and supervisor-policy evidence are bounded as below. Physical pixels, reference visibility, confinement and drain remain unqualified; no reclamation. | `h264-vga-20261019/root-integration.json`; `h264-launcher-20261019/root-integration.json`; `h264-supervisor-entry-20261019/result.json` |
| [JPEG](jpeg-application.md) | Authenticated supplied baseline YCbCr420 image and copied pixels with dimensions; independent oracle optional. Pixel correctness and confinement remain physically unqualified. | `jpeg-runtime-input-20261018/` |
| [Crypto](crypto-application.md) | Bounded caller SHA-256/AES-128 ECB, private input and request-bound output; key-cleanup and fragment-handling review resolved. Physical engine operation, secure access and drain remain unqualified. | `crypto-runtime-input-20261018/` |
| [USB HID/CPU IRQ](usb2-host.md) | LS/FS/HS HID copies four reports without desktop events. Supervised board option routes CPU0 INTID187 to the existing owner; other profiles poll. IRQ delivery, DMA/drain, power and attachment reuse remain unqualified. | `usb-host-interrupt-20261018/root-integration.json`; `usb-host-cpu-irq-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [USB hub/dual leaf](usb2-host.md) | Workload 4: one self-powered HS USB2 hub, one LS/FS/HS HID plus one HS MSC. Joint immutable output requires both results and fresh attachment. Existing IRQ187 route retained; derived profiles keep workloads 0–3. Hub/TT, power, DMA and drain remain unqualified. | `usb-host-dual-leaf-20261019/root-integration.json`; earlier single leaf: `usb-host-hub-20261019/` |
| [USB Gen1 BOT](usb2-host.md#one-direct-gen1-storage-device-uses-comb0) | Workload 6, direct read-only LBA0, source-backed COMB0; no USB2 fallback. Requires authenticated ≥900 mA and image-bound physical route/rail/clock/source-switch evidence; none exists. Gen2, hubs/HID, streams, wider classes and safe detach/drain remain required. | `usb-host-superspeed-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [Thermal](thermal-application.md), [ADC](adc-application.md), [finite USB](usb.md) | Finite applications and return adapters integrated. Thermal/ADC retain configuration and leases; ADC needs fitted-divider electrical admission. Physical operations/return remain unqualified. | `thermal-adc-returning-source-20261018/integration.json`; `usb-returning-20261018/integration.json` |
| [RTC source/alarm](rtc-application.md) | Separate source initialization and external-source alarm paths. Source admission precedes alarm use; success requires verified Secure interrupt-state restoration, not only a completion message. | `rtc-source-returning-20261018/integration.json`; `rtc-alarm-returning-20261018/integration.json` |
| [NPU runtime/IRQ](npu-application.md), [service](npu-service.md) | Retained same-model SUBMIT/READ/copied output/REAP/CLOSE; IRQ97 owner alone acknowledges. Bootstrap plus two finite inferences require three notified completions and stopped receipt. Source-off CLOSE/GIC stop precede release; retained runtime keeps OS/USB live without ROM return. | `npu-interrupt-service-20261019/root-integration.json`; `npu-runtime-input-20261019/dma-reconcile/root-integration.json` |
| [NPU two-stage graph](npu-two-stage.md) | Fixed two fused convolution/ReLU stages, 64 input/eight output bytes, internal SRAM and one graph completion. CPU/SDK references pass; native output/service are modeled. No mimus replacement or physical inference claim. | `npu-two-stage-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [NPU SH/NT graph](npu-relative-shift.md) | Fixed FP32 four-head/128-step relative shift, external pool cleared before each job, chunked copied input/output and healthy CLOSE. Two reused-network SDK outputs match FP32 bits; native replies/IRQ/cache/transport are modeled. No unchanged-encoder acceleration. | `npu-relative-shift-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [Complete NPU NN graph](npu-complete-nn.md) | Published 125-operation ShuffleNetV2 graph with coefficients/pool; two copied jobs and CLOSE. Both SDK input patterns saturate to `[0,255]`, with undocumented classes: no input-sensitive accuracy, physical inference or mimus acceleration claim. | `npu-complete-nn-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [GPU programs/live input](gpu-compiled-programs.md) | Trusted sealed program, same-shape copied input, exact-sequence READ and CLOSE. Separate multi-dispatch and true 1D/2D grid profiles admit up to 31 workgroups/992 elements with 32 lanes. Numerical execution and device-cache visibility remain modeled/unqualified. | `gpu-dispatch-geometry-20261019/`; `gpu-workgroup-grid-20261019/root-integration.json`; `gpu-runtime-input-20261019/dma-header-integration/root-integration.json` |
| [GPU indexed textures/repeated drawing](gpu-render.md) | Caller float4 positions/float2 UV, uint16 triangle indices and RGBA8 texture/output through 1080p; trusted nearest/clamp/LOD0 shaders. Guarded copied snapshots retain download credit until complete USB delivery. GPU effects are modeled; linked app also models service replies. Physical graphics/confinement, arbitrary shaders, perspective/depth/blend, wider modes, display presentation and disposal remain required. Separate 64×64 triangle profile retained. | `gpu-textured-render-20261019/root-integration.json`, `root-layout-final.json`; `gpu-repeated-draw-20261019/root-integration.json` |
| [GPU returning application](gpu-application.md), [NPU returning application](npu-application.md) | Workers stop and PMIC parks before cleanup. Reviewed Nonsecure publication and matched host restoration are preserved separately from retained live-input profiles. Physical inference and ROM return remain unqualified; critical frozen scopes are below. | `gpu-returning-repeat-fix-20261019/root-review.json`; `gpu-returning-host-20261019/root-host-source-review.json`; `npu-finite-return-20261018/frozen/`; `npu-finite-host-20261018/root-host-source-review.json` |

## Blockers and image-specific evidence boundaries

- **I2S cyclic RX/duplex:** physical admission requires
  `cyclic-rx-completion-and-reuse-ordering-established`; no qualifying record
  exists. The completed-package counter does not explicitly order destination
  writes and cursor updates. CPU-cache review alone is insufficient. Preserve
  `i2s-hardware-cyclic-20261019/root-cache-review.json` and
  `identity-reuse-clarification.json`; standalone-client cases model service calls.
- **Bluetooth:** seven composed/eight native operation cases retain ELF
  `36bfa257…`; final `388f9f93…` changes five objects for exact profile guards.
  Its final-image case covers version admission and copied PCM commit only.
  Earlier repeated-recognition USB cases also retain their earlier image;
  `identity-reuse.json` binds the changed finished/status case. Pinned libsbc 2.0
  is CPU code under LGPL-2.1-or-later; preserve source/notices/relinkable objects
  via [the manifest](../apps/bluetooth/msbc-source.json). Default CVSD omits it.
- **H.264:** the historical `862fae444a481eb9505d8ba7ef3835760e208764663c1e7aef8459f8b9be43ac`
  omits VE counter-read permission and cannot publish completed output. Its
  substituted-read compositions are historical only. VGA `24144b2a…` includes the
  correction and real lower IOMMU policy checks; normal-mode evidence stops after
  frame one with terminal status pending. Use the corrected AArch32 launcher in
  new VGA bundles; old frozen bundles reject version 2. Launcher tests stop at
  modeled reset handoff; the 59-second supervisor-policy sentinel stops before
  queues, evidence creation or USB. Full-HD `b48123e3…` has separate private
  contract/sealing evidence; neither path executes shared startup or proves pixels.
- **GPU:** the corrected fixed-return candidate is
  `2ab2cb1b3bac150d5eb695793ab0eb39bb453afc7fbd7ecb2f595ebfca3fd08d`.
  Publish through Nonsecure EL1 mappings before SMC; earlier EL3-only publication
  results are superseded. Root review passes; physical admission remains false.
  The historical two-job
  image has the NEW-only callback defect and is superseded for repeated submit.
  Keep `gpu-returning-application-20261019/ns-publication/` and
  `gpu-returning-host-20261019/` within their publication/host scopes. GPU-cache
  ordering still depends on the pinned firmware's per-job contract; CPU cache
  maintenance alone does not establish device-cache visibility.
- **NPU returns:** preserve `npu-finite-quiescence-20261018/integration.json`,
  `npu-supply-returning-20261018/integration.json` and
  `npu-finite-host-20261018/transport-frozen/`. SRE tasks run at EL1t; cached SMP
  task/exit rules do not transfer. Stop communication after transport failure;
  retain ownership. Root retains architectural return review.
- **Supervisor entry:** host-only corrections admit DSI and UART result keys.
  The actual caller reaches a readiness sentinel before queue or device access:
  `dsi-supervisor-entry-20261019/result.json`, `frozen/manifest.json`. This
  establishes neither native startup nor hardware operation; H.264 was not rerun.
  UART entry passes the same boundary under `uart-supervisor-entry-20261019/`.
  Its `caller-audit.json` confirms admitted keys for all 21 existing production
  callers, including both conditional GPU profiles; device cases were not repeated.
- **Physical device preparation:** DSI needs a selected panel and image-bound
  electrical/PLL, rail/bank-voltage, wiring, isolation and fetch-padding facts;
  model-only authority is refused. USB Gen1 has no authenticated physical source
  record. Type-C cutoff cannot remove an external hub's supply. Combined mimus
  needs fresh DDR/model-memory, power, DMA and recovery admission; its injected
  native transcript does not establish physical concurrent recognition/storage.

## Continuation and evidence reuse

1. Continue complete native device paths and missing modes in the hardware matrix;
   integrate reviewed work promptly. Keep component owners' shared drivers and
   startup untouched unless a concrete dependency requires coordination. Update
   canonical hardware/component records and existing issues for accepted changes.
2. Preserve each accepted ELF, full source/object closure, generated inputs and
   evidence scope. Shared USB headers change embedded layouts even in consumers
   whose USB host path is inactive. Audits match their named integration revision,
   not every future HEAD. Future builds compile affected consumers consistently;
   do not rebuild old images merely to catch up. SD `141078f4…` matched `894051d`.
3. Reuse accepted checks while relevant inputs match; a commit, documentation edit
   or handoff is not a rerun reason. Follow [selective validation](validation.md)
   and the [reference index](reference-index.md). Tables above select continuation
   records; their linked component documents preserve full evidence inventories.
4. When physical recovery is available, the primary agent refreshes identity,
   clock/power/memory/DMA facts and board-specific admission before one justified
   CPU or independent device test. Preserve the final-writer barrier, Nonsecure
   publication and matched shutdown. Fixtures supply no physical authority.
5. Require established recovery before persistent writes. Keep intentional
   watchdog expiry and the failed historical UFS probe deferred; absent eMMC/UFS
   are not current qualification blockers. Preserve both cards.
6. Qualify unchanged-model mimus and representative concurrent OS workloads.
   After every required hardware function works, optimize complete recognition
   to at most 0.05 times audio duration; investigate 0.01 times as a bounded stretch.
   Report loading and live latency separately. Reproducible boot images,
   recovery/update procedures and physical qualification remain goal requirements.

The [historical handoff](handoff-history-20261019.md) preserves older integration,
recovery and validation context; it supplies no current launch authority.
